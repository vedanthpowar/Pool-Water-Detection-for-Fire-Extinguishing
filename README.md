# Pool-Water-Detection-for-Fire-Extinguishing

Satellite images are a precious resource in the aftermath
of natural disasters such as hurricanes and tsunamis,
where they can be used for risk assessment and disaster
management. In order to provide timely and actionable
information for disaster response, it is essential to
identify impacted areas and accessible roads in
post-disaster scenarios.

One such example can be of finding the nearest source of
water in case of large forest fires. Naturally occurring
water bodies are often covered by maps but man made
structures such as swimming pools are often missed out
and might be an easily accessible source.

The problem statement for Round 2 of Mosaicâ€™22 is to
segment out swimming pools present in a given aerial
image.
A sample dataset will be given, containing images of
various sizes, zoom percentages and quality. And the
labels file, for each image with swimming pools in it
there is a corresponding PASCAL VOC annotations file.
However, you are free to use any external dataset to
train your models.
